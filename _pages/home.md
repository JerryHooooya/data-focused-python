This course focuses on the fundamentals of computer programming using the Python interpreted programming language. Students will develop his or her problem solving skills using the divideand-conquer and top-down approaches to build real-world based software applications. Students will also learn the basics of the software
development lifecycle: planning, development, testing, implementation and maintenance. Assignments will include individual coding assignments and weekly fundamental checkpoint quizzes culminating with an individual final project to test essential programming and problem solving skills.

*Note: The course schedule and assignments are subject to change. Please see your Enterprise Learning Management System (e.g. Canvas, Blackboard, Desire2Learn) for the official schedule.*

## Individual Project Assignments

The project is a collection of [individual programming assignments](individual-project/project-description.md) that have required and optional components. The assignments are graded according to a rubric. Individual assignments will have both must have requirements and stretch requirements. Completion of the must have requirements "Meet Expectations". Sophistication, completeness, and style of the stretch requirements will contribute to students "Exceeding Expectations" or delivering "Superior Work".
